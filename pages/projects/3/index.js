        <h2>Core Components</h2>
        <p>The drone is designed with a robust architecture combining power efficiency, autonomous control, and intelligent onboard systems. Its power system ensures long-lasting operation with redundancy for safety, while the flight control system leverages Pixhawk/SpeedyBee controllers, STM32 subsystems, and integrated sensors (IMU, GPS) for precise autonomous navigation. A lightweight yet durable propulsion system with high-efficiency motors and balanced propellers provides stable lift and maneuverability. For communication, the drone supports FS-i6S radio control, long-range telemetry, and ELRS transmitters, enabling reliable, low-latency control and monitoring. Advanced onboard processing with ESP32 allows expansion into machine vision, with FPV and modular cameras offering real-time video, situational awareness, and object-tracking capabilities.</p>

          <span className={styles['listing-heading']}>Project Soteria is being developed in parallel with TARZAN, our autonomous car project. Both platforms share a common vision of modular autonomy and real-time tracking. The current phase of development involves exploring cross-integration, where TARZANâ€™s ground-based navigation and decision-making systems will be tested in tandem with Soteriaâ€™s aerial capabilities.</span>
        
        <span className={styles['listing-heading']}>By combining aerial and ground perspectives, we aim to create a coordinated autonomous ecosystem where Soteria provides aerial reconnaissance and mapping, while TARZAN executes precise ground-level maneuvers. This synergy is expected to strengthen both projects, expand their real-world applications, and set the foundation for multi-agent autonomous systems.</span>
